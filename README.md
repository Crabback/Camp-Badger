# Camp-Badger

The staff of UW Madison’s Recreation & Wellbeing Division have decided to start up a new
overnight summer camp for kids age 8-14 named ”Camp Badger”. Hearing of your awesome
programming skills, they have decided to come to you for assistance. You and your team
are tasked with creating an enrollment application that uses a binary search tree to manage
campers as well as provide some other basic functionalities such as assigning cabins and general
statistics.
